Sonoff-T1 seems to be an evolution of Sonoff-Touch, and exists in one, two or three button variations and contains a 433MHz radio.

Sonoff Touch is also based on the ESP8285, But are using a Silabs EFM8BB1 microcontroller to extend the number of IO:s needed to control 3 buttons, with separate relays and leds together with the radio.
