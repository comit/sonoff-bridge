How to setup and configure Arduino IDE for Tasmota compilation and upload.


## Download
Download Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

I prefer a *dedicated standalone version* of the IDE allowing easy ESP8266 file manipulation and library management. This can be achieved by downloading the Arduino IDE ZIP file for non admin install.

## Install
Unzip the installation file to a known folder.

IMPORTANT: Before executing *arduino.exe* add an empty folder called *portable* in the known folder.
