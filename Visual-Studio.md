How to setup and configure Visual Studio (VS) for Tasmota.

## Download
Download VS from https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Install
Install VS after downloading

## Configure
Configure VS for Arduino with ESP8266 support.

How? You tell me.

As far as I can tell the VS Arduino Extension needs access to an installed Arduino IDE. Make sure you use a freshly installed Arduino IDE as the extension initially will remove any reference to ESP8266 (at least that's what happenend in my case).
