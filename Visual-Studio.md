How to setup and configure Visual Studio for Tasmota.

## Download

## Install
Install the tool after downloading

## Configure
Configure Visual Studio for Arduino with ESP8266 support.

How? You tell me.

As far as I can tell the VS Arduino Extension needs access to an installed Arduino IDE. Make sure you use a freshly installed Arduino IDE as the extension initially will remove any reference to ESP8266 (at least that's what happenend in my case).
