How to setup and configure Visual Studio for Tasmota compilation and upload.

## Download
Download Visual Studio from https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Install
Install Visual Studio after downloading

## Configure
Configure Visual Studio for Arduino with ESP8266 support.

How? You tell me.

As far as I can tell the Visual Studio Arduino Extension needs access to an installed Arduino IDE. Make sure you use a freshly installed Arduino IDE as the extension initially will remove any reference to ESP8266 (at least that's what happenend in my case).
