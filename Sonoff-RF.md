## Pairing a RF remote control
During programming a connection for R21 is needed in order to use a button press to ground GPIO0.

To pair a RF remote control with the Sonoff RF it is important that there is NO connection made for R21.

User [gadjet](https://github.com/gadjet) installed a jumper in place of R21 allowing easy programming (jumper in), pairing (jumper out) and normal use (jumper out).
