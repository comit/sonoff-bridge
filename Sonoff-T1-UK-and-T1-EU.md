The Sonoff T1 UK with 1 to 3 gang dated 2017-6-18 is fully supported by Tasmota starting with version 5.6.1.

Newer versions of the hardware may or may not work as has been noted in issue #1424 below. The community has proven the most recent UK versions supplied with 1.6.2 firmware are working with Tasmota v5.11.1 and possibly earlier versions too.

## Sonoff T1 EU

The Sonoff T1 EU version has not been verified by me (Theo) but may or may not work.

Sonoff-T1 seems to be an evolution of Sonoff-Touch, and exists in one, two or three button variations and contains a 433MHz radio.

Sonoff Touch is also based on the ESP8285, But are using a Silabs EFM8BB1 microcontroller to extend the number of IO:s needed to control 3 buttons, with separate relays and leds together with the radio. SYN470R is used as 433Mhz Radio, and chip for touch is unlabeled

## Serial Connection

![Connections](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29403034/33187392-5a4902e4-d089-11e7-9522-ab7e70301c58.jpg)

There is 3 connectors available on the top board J1 to J3.
J1 is tied to EFM8BB1:
1. VDD
2. DATA
3. CLOCK
4. GND

J2 goes to the relay board (Pins counted cw):
1. Relay 3
2. Relay 1
7. Relay 2
8. Some kind of relay feedback.

J3 is a serial pinout, with the same pins as sonoff basic:
1. VDD
2. RX
3. TX
4. GND
5. GPIO02

With standard firmware, i get a short print out with an non-standard board rate: 74 880bps (esp8285 bootloader bitrate)

## Flashing

The following board layouts are from the 3 variants of the Sonoff T1 UK variant and are marked Sonoff T1 R2 UK Touch Board, Ver 1.0. These are the currently supplied versions shipping with firmware version 1.6.2.  
This version of the stock firmware makes them unsuitable for flashing with SonOTA which only works on versions up to 1.6. Version 1.6 onwards removed the broadcast WiFi network for configuration.

Entering Flashing mode varies between the 1 2 and 3 channel versions. See the above picture for button nomenclature used.
  (The variations between the 3 versions appear to be managed by the touch IC rather than in the ESP).  
To enter flashing mode the unit should be powered and connected to the programmer of choice. Touch Button 1 should then be held while the reset button (4) is pressed. This will cause the unit to reboot into flash mode. This is confirmed on a serial console (74880 baud) by the boot mode displaying (1,x) indicating that we are booted to the bootloader and not the flash.

The front circuit board should be disconnected from the rear relay board to prevent power draw upsetting the flashing process. The unit must be powered up before attempting to enter programming mode, as per the above instructions. The ESP will not go into programming mode if touch button 1 is held while power is connected. The touch IC does not have time to recognise the key-press before the ESP boots. 

Tasmota can then be flashed and configured as usual. Once booted, the module type will need to be configured to a T1 1/2/3CH.

## Circuit
I tried to reverse engineer the circuit and I noticed:

ESP8285
```

GPIO0 EFM8BB1 P1,3 (Goes low when first touch button is pressed)
GPIO04 is connected to the small (soft) reset button on the front.
GPIO09 EFM8BB1 P1,4
GPIO10 EFM8BB1 P1,5
GPIO13 is connected to status LED D3.
```

On the EFM8BB1 (QFN20 package)
```
P0,0 Relay 1
P0,1 Relay 2
P0,2 Relay 3
P0,3 Button 1
P0,4 Button 2
P0,5 Button 3
P0,6 SYN470R Data Out
P0,7 Relay protection?
P1,0 Led button 1
P1,1 Led button 2
P1,2 Led button 3
P1,3 ESP8285 GPIO0
P1,4 ESP8285 GPIO09
P1,5 ESP8285 GPIO10
P1,6 ESP8285 EXT_RSTB (RESET)
```

## Known so far
* It seems that the state of the 3 relays are saved inside the EFM8BB1, and not inside the ESP8285.
* When pushing a button, the touch chip lift the power high to the EFM8BB1, and the EFM8BB1 chip ties the signal line for each button low, for the full duration of the keypress. There is no serial data, that i have seen at all.

## Unknown so far

* How does the ESP8285 change and read the the state inside EFM8BB1. We only know that the ESP8285 can read if button is pressed or not, but now how the ESP8285 changes or reads the state.  
* Is the 433MHz remote function supported? I suspect it is as it is not managed by the ESP
