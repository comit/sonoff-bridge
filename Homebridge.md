HomeBridge is using Node.js to provide Home Automation.

Sonoff-Tasmota plugins have been developed by [macwynawca](https://www.npmjs.com/~macwyznawca)

Homebridge is a unofficial server that emulates the iOS HomeKit API. Thanks HomeBridge you can use unsupported devices (like Sonoff) in applications compatible with HomeKit.
