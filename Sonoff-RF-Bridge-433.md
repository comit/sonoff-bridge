Please see the [Hardware Preparation](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Hardware-Preparation) page for general instructions.

As always, you need to access the serial interface. The **four serial pins** (3V3, Rx, Tx, GND) connected to the esp8266 are available on the 5-pin header just below the switch as can be seen in the upper part of the image to the right.

Move the switch towards the 5-pin header, keep the button pressed and connect the serial programmer.
