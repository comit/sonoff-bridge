## Serial Connection

<img alt="picture of the Sonoff Pow PCB, the needed pin header can be seen on the top end" src="https://www.itead.cc/wiki/images/e/e3/Sonoff-Pow-00.JPG" width="40%" align="right" />

Please see the [Hardware Preparation](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Hardware-Preparation) page for general instructions.

As always, you need to access the serial interface. The **four serial pins** (3V3, Rx, Tx, GND) are available at the rear/short end of the PCB as can be seen in the upper part of the image to the right.
